Self calling functions / Immediately invoked functions
------------------------------------------------------
(function() {
  
	var a = 5, b=10;
  console.log(a, b);
	
})()

Ex: self invoked function folder

- All the variables become local to that self calling function block only. 
- Self calling functions can be used to prevent polluting global scope.

AJAX
====
AJAX - Asynchronous Javascript And Xml

It's not a programming language. It's a technique to hit server and change webpage content without re-loading page.

function getTodos(success, failure) {
  var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
  xhttp.open("GET", "https://todos-api-dev.herokuapp.com/todos");
  xhttp.send();
  xhttp.onreadystatechange = function() {
    if (this.readyState == 4 && this.status == 200) {
      success(this.responseText);
    } else {
      failure();
    }
  };
}

The onreadystatechange property specifies a function to be executed every time the status of the XMLHttpRequest object changes.
When readyState property is 4 and the status property is 200, the response is ready.

Different readyStates available are below,
0	UNSENT - Client has been created. open() not called yet.
1	OPENED - open() has been called.
2	HEADERS_RECEIVED - send() has been called, and headers and status are available.
3	LOADING	- Downloading; responseText holds partial data.
4	DONE - The operation is complete.
